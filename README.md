# Android Build Variants Demo Repository

Welcome to this repository which serves as a practical demonstration on how to configure and utilize build variants, specifically product flavors in an Android project. The essence of establishing build variants is to allow for the seamless differentiation and management of app behaviors across various development stages while maintaining a single codebase.

In this repository, three distinct product flavors have been set up:

1. **Development**: This variant is optimized for rapid development and testing, with configurations set for a debuggable environment.
2. **Staging**: Serving as an intermediary between development and production, this variant is geared towards a testing environment that closely mirrors the production setup but with some debugging capabilities enabled.
3. **Production**: This is the variant that's ready for release to end-users, with all debugging capabilities disabled and optimizations for performance and security applied.
